    MY GRADE (3/4 in css)
    Learning from my mistakes here.
    First, you have p as it's own class. Probably not a good idea. 
    The instructions were hinting at a first class name of "odd". Change this. 
    In odd, you just didn't know that Verdana could be used without quotes, 
    but I think generally: no spaces = no quotes needed.

    Second, similar-font works! (+1)

    Third, both IDs are correct (+2)

    Overall, the html side was correct. It was only adjusted due to the addition
    of the "odd" class here, which would have added an additional class with space on
    Line 3. Give it a (4/5)

    Final score: 7/10 (70%). But we learned from our mistakes!
